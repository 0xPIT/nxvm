current bad ip: 0x2eab
watch value: gdtr.base (0x139380, bad=0x139780)
value is loaded from 0x343c, hence watch 0x343e

current bad ip: 0x17854, R: 0x5ca8 W: 0x343c

The Generation of 0x00139780:
cs:eip=0f5e:00005a13(L00014ff3)
opr1=00138f80 opr2=00000800 result=00139780 ADR+   OPR+   ADD  BX,[BP+08]    [R:L0001548c/4/00000800] 
xx.log@60217

Now: try to figure out why not 138b80 but 138f80
note: xg, then xg 14ff3x3, then record on, then xg 14ff3
Found bad ip: 0x14fee, ecx is de000 not dec00

(4) at 0x1a139, mov eax, 1000(2844)
at 0x1b5f8, ecx decreased by 1000. it should be 400 only

(5) bochs write 0x1526c for 0x0400 at 0x14fa5(2929)!
upto:  at 0x1a139, mov eax, 1000(2844)

(6) bochs write 0x1526c for 0x0400 at 0x14fa5(2929)!
upto:  at 0x14912, mov ecx, eax (2899)

**NEW BUG: EBX=120000/121000, write to 15250/15270 at 14f9b
(6.1) when esi = 0x5c44, turn record on.
      at its 0x1a139, trace.
......
1a14d, why ax ends with 0x67 not 0x65

(6.2) 1a1fc: EAX should become 0xff???, not 0xe1???
  here is a loop between each instruction 0x1a1fc.
  my program exits at 0x1e067, but bochs ends at 0xff067.
  after the loop, the program goes to 0x14ff3.
  what's the difference??
(6.3) look at ins 0x1a0fe, then single step exec in bochs
   found that at 0x1a0fe, eax=0xe1, ecx is wrong: 0x0e not 0x01
   since this ecx is read at 0x1a0f3 from 0x123e2 by MOVZX as 0xe    but in bochs, at mem 0x123e2, it should be 0x01. let's trace.
 this 0xe was written at 0x13d3d, bl is 0xe
(6.4) test case save point
test
xg
xw w 123e2
xg 13d3d
q/record on/debug
**set up watch point and do:
xg 13d3d
q/record dump d:\x.log

** RESET
(1) bad ip: 0xf4128, write the GDT
